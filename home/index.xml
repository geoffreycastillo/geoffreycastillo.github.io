      <description>Choice consistency and the attraction effect
The attraction effect violates consistency requirements at the heart of rational choice, but despite its profound implications it has barely attracted attention in economics. I present a laboratory experiment aimed at testing the attraction effect and at disentangling some of its explanations using novel manipulations. I find the attraction effect and I also uncover a new &amp;lsquo;range effect&amp;rsquo; that runs against it. This range effect lends support to recent theories based on focusing and salience.</description>
